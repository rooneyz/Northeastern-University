## Comments

* Product description (with at least 1 screenshot): 5/5
* User analysis: 5/5
* Task analysis: 20/20 
* Context, situations, environment: 10/10
* Conceptual design: 18/20
  * This section is presenting a list of GUI features, rather than key objects and actions
    * Conceptual design is generally independent of the specific GUI
    * For example, key objects include:
      * Documents
      * Users
      * Tables
      * Images
      * Sections
      * Paragraphics
      * Characters
      * Attributes
      * Versions
      * Permissions
    * Key actions include:
      * Inserting
      * Deleting
      * Changing attributes
      * Opening
      * Saving
      * Sharing
      * Chatting
    * Most editing actions (e.g. insert, delete, change attributes) can be performed on multiple objects
* Design metaphors: 10/10
  * The buttons use shapes to indicate the actions they perform, but are they design metaphors?
  * For example, the file and folder are metaphors for the file system of an OS.
  * Key design metaphors for most WYSIWYG word processors include:
    * Formatted and paginated text as metaphors for document structure and attributes
    * Rules and guides as metaphors for layout specifications
    * Text fonts and styles as metaphors for style specifications
* Design critique: 10/10
* Design improvements: 10/10
* Future testing: 10/10
