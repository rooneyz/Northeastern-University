## Comments

* General
  * Need to think through storyboards as basis enacting user testing
  * Give more thought to goals of usability tests and how analyzed

* Storyboards (10/20)
  * The point of storyboards is to show detailed scenarios that can be enacted during testing
  * The scenarios in this solution lack any UI or user interaction to test
    * They cannot be used to construct a paper prototype for testing.
    * They are just concept sketches that could be done before any design took place
  The good news is that the 3 scenarios might serve as a basis for storyboards

* Paper prototype (30/30)

* Usability testing plan (19/20)
  * Where did all the performance numbers come from?
    * based on competing products?
    * computed from theoretical KLM calculations?
    * made up for this purpose?
    * if you list perfornce, do not just make it up
      * consult literature
      * evaluate competing products
      * derive from models of expeced performnce

* Discussion and analysis (30/30)
