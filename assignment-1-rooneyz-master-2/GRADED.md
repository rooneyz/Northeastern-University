problem 2 - Your code seems to struggle with 2 digit numbers. In a list of "1 2 3 14" your code returns 3 as the largest number.

(2 points removed)



problem 3 - Does not return the correct amount of subdirectories, returns a greater number

the problem is in ur wc argument. see prof solution!

also u should do "${1}" instead of $1 to be safer, things can go wrong if u dont make it a habit, see me if u have questions about this
