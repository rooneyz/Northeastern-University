Great working code! 

-5 Not well documented. You are missing javadoc style for the class, most of your fields and a few functions. 

You have many test cases, and you have clearly thought your code through and made it very functional. Next steps would be to clean it up. 
Theres a ton of code, you didnt need or use. Theres a bunch of repeated code. It certainly tells the story of you working through the assignment, but it hurts the overall readability of the code.

Come talk to me sometime. I would be happy to walk you through the do's and dont's as I know them of writing clean code.
Oh, and turn in the correctly named source file, not the entire zipped folder. Later classes run homeworks via automation and if theyre off even a letter they wont run and youll get a zero, if the assignment says to title something. title it that EXACTLY.
